# A utility-based analysis of equilibria in multi-objective normal form games

Study of Nash and correlated equilibria in MONFGs, under the SER (scalarised expected returns) and ESR (expected scalarized returns) multi-objective criterion.

## Paper citation

This fork expands upon the code used for experimentation in the following paper:

## Getting Started

Experiments can be run from the `MONFG.py` file. There are  MONFGs available, having different equilibria properties under the SER optimisation criterion, using the specified non linear utility functions. 

The code-base can also be adjusted as needed to run single-objective normal form games such as chicken, battle of the sexes, the prisoners dilemma, etc.
